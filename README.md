# System-Data-Visualization

This project focuses on automating visual report (built using Plotly) generation by integrating python scripts & power-point templates into standalone executable files (.exe) using auto-py-to-exe converter, reducing manual effort and cutting report creation time by over 95%. I have used Pandas for data-processing & cleaning and Plotly to create charts/visuals in the python scrips.
